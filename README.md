# jennyk√•berg.se - Frontend

## Description

I am studying Front End Developer at Medieinstitutet in Stockholm, Sweden. This project is my exam assignment.

My sister is a silversmith and metalworker and has her own workshop. She produces unique creations that are exclusively handmade. I wanted to make a website where she can display her products in a way that justifies their beauty and at the same time makes it easy for customers to place orders or reach out with questions.

The users are able to navigate through all pages and save products to their wishlist, place orders and ask questions about the products.

My goal was to create a visually appealing website where users can browse products and place requests that will be sent from the backend to an email address. These requests will also be stored in a database.
